# ChatBot iOS App

## Overview
ChatBot is an iOS application that simulates a conversation with an AI assistant. It demonstrates the implementation of a simple chatbot using Swift and UIKit, showcasing basic natural language processing and UI interactions in iOS.

## Features
- Real-time chat interface
- AI-powered responses to user queries
- Support for various conversation topics including science, history, philosophy, and more
- Time-aware responses that can incorporate the current date and time
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technical Stack
- Swift 5
- UIKit
- Xcode 12+
- iOS 13.0+

## Project Structure
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and consists of the following key components:

- `ViewController.swift`: Manages the main UI and user interactions
- `ConversationDataSource.swift`: Handles the storage and retrieval of chat messages
- `ConversationDelegate.swift`: Contains the logic for generating AI responses
- `Message.swift`: Defines the data structure for chat messages
